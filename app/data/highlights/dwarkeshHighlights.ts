dwarkeshHighlights.set("66", "Had so much fun chatting with my good friends Trenton Bricken and Sholto Douglas on the podcast. This is the best context dump out there on how LLMs are trained, what capabilities they're likely to soon have, and what exactly is going on inside them.")
dwarkeshHighlights.set("65", "Here is my episode with Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind. We discuss: why scaling is an artform, adding search, planning, & AlphaZero type training atop LLMs, making sure rogue nations can’t steal weights, and the right way to align superhuman AIs and do an intelligence explosion.")
dwarkeshHighlights.set("64", "We discuss: what it takes to process $1 trillion/year, how to build multi-decade APIs, companies, and relationships, what's next for Stripe (increasing the GDP of the internet is quite an open ended prompt, and the Collison brothers are just getting started).")
dwarkeshHighlights.set("63", "It was a great pleasure speaking with Tyler Cowen for the 3rd time. We discussed how Hayek, Keynes, Smith, and other great economists help us make sense of AI, growth, risk, human nature, anarchy, central planning, and much more.")

dwarkeshHighlights.set("60", "A true honor to speak with Jung Chang. She is the author of Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China (sold 15+ million copies worldwide) and Mao: The Unknown Story. We discuss: what it was like growing up during the Cultural Revolution as the daughter of a denounced official, why the CCP continues to worship the biggest mass murderer in human history, how exactly Communist totalitarianism was able to subjugate a billion people, why Chinese leaders like Xi and Deng who suffered from the Cultural Revolution don’t condemn Mao, and how Mao starved and killed 40 million people during The Great Leap Forward in order to exchange food for Soviet weapons Wild Swans is the most moving book I’ve ever read. It was a real privilege to speak with its author.")
dwarkeshHighlights.set("59", "Andrew Roberts is the world’s best biographer and one of the leading historians of our time.

We discuss why Western governments are so dangerously broken and how to fix them before an even more catastrophic crisis.")
dwarkeshHighlights.set("57", "Talked with Paul Christiano (world’s leading AI safety researcher) about: Does he regret inventing RLHF? What do we want post-AGI world to look like (do we want to keep gods enslaved forever)? Why he has relatively modest timelines (40% by 2040, 15% by 2030)? Why he’s leading the push to get to labs develop responsible scaling policies? And what it would take to prevent an AI coup or bioweapon? As well as his current research into a new proof system, and how this could solve alignment by explaining model’s behavior, and much more.")
dwarkeshHighlights.set("56", "I had a lot of fun chatting with Shane Legg - Founder & Chief AGI Scientist, Google DeepMind! We discuss: Why he expects AGI around 2028? How to align superhuman models?

dwarkeshHighlights.set("55", "I had a lot of fun chatting with Grant Sanderson (who runs the excellent 3Blue1Brown YouTube channel) about: Whether advanced math requires AGI? What careers should mathematically talented students pursue? Why Grant plans on doing a stint as a high school teacher? Tips for self teaching? Does Godel’s incompleteness theorem actually matter? Why are good explanations so hard to find?")
dwarkeshHighlights.set("54", "I learned so much from Sarah Paine, Professor of History and Strategy at the Naval War College. We discuss: How continental vs maritime powers think and how this explains Xi & Putin’s decisions? How a war with China over Taiwan would shake out and whether it could go nuclear? Why the British Empire fell apart, why China went communist, how Hitler and Japan could have coordinated to win WW2, and whether Japanese occupation was good for Korea, Taiwan and Manchuria? How to study history properly? And why leaders keep making the same mistakes? In addition to other lessons from WW2, Cold War, and Sino-Japanese War.")
dwarkeshHighlights.set("53", "Here is my conversation with Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic. Dario is hilarious and has fascinating takes on what these models are doing, why they scale so well, and what it will take to align them.")
dwarkeshHighlights.set("52", "A few weeks ago, I sat beside Andy Matuschak to record how he reads a textbook. Even though my own job is to learn things, I was shocked with how much more intense, painstaking, and effective his learning process was. So I asked if we could record a conversation about how he learns and a bunch of other topics.")
