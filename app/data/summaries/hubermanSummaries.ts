    "Reflexive pathways include areas of the brainstem called central pattern generators (CPGs).",
    "Deliberate actions require more attention and engage the forebrain for top-down processing to control those central pattern generators (CPGs).",
    "Neuroplasticity is the process in which neurons change connections so you can go from things being challenging to things being reflexive.",
    "Plasticity is the process by which neurons can change their connections in the way they work so that you. Adaptive plasticitiy is plasticity that you can self-direct.",
    "Young brains are incredibly plastic but adults can take actionable steps to improve plasticity",
    "Two sets of neuromodulators in the brain can affect plasticity: epinephrine and acetylcholine.",
    "Epinephrine comes from a subset of neurons in the brainstem and creates alertness. Acetylcholine comes from an area of the forebrain and highlights whatever neurons were active during that period of heightened alertness.",
    "Sleep is a critical piece to optimize neuroplasticity: plasticity doesn’t take place in real-time, it happens during sleep and deep rest – get better at falling asleep and staying asleep.",
    "Aligning with 90-minute ultradian rhythms will help you optimize performance and learning.",
    "Test learning new information at different times throughout the day to see when you are most optimal."
