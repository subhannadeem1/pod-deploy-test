            A “Web Cookie” is a string of information that a website stores on a

            each time the user submits a query to the site. We use Web Cookies
            to track the pages that users visit during each Site session, both
            to help us improve users' experiences and to help us understand how
            the Site is being used. As with other non-Personal Information

            aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to
            help us, our partners and others better understand how the Site is

          <p className="px-2 mx-2 my-2 text-xs">
            A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page that is
            usually invisible to the user and allows website operators to check
            whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email. We may
            use Web Beacons on the Site and in emails to count users who have
            visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded
            services. Web Beacons are not used to access users' Personal
            Information; they are a technique we may use to compile aggregated
            statistics about Site usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set
            of information including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a
            page or email view, and a description of the page or email on which
            the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons, however,
            they can be rendered ineffective by declining all Web Cookies or
            modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie
            is tendered and permit you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an
            individual basis.
